What is EasyForger
==================

EasyForger is a DSL for writing Minecraft Mods in Scala. It is written on top of [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge),
making it slightly easier to use. Knowing how it works though can be helpful, specially for writing more advanced mods. That
being said, you can start with zero knowledge and go from there.

EasyForger is highly opinionated: it is made for writing mods in _Scala_. You probably could use it with other JVM languages,
but this is not tested nor supported at this point.

Finally, EasyForger is also a big experimentation, meaning that things can change, until we find a DSL definition that _feels right_.
You can also influence that: if you think something could be done better, just getting in touch and speak your mind!
